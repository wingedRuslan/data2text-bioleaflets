another infected person. the virus is found in body fluids such as faeces, serum or saliva. symptoms begin 3 to 6 weeks after infection. some people can feel sick, have a fever and aches and pains.

breathlessness or wheezing. if you get this sort of attack you must use a quick - acting inhaler ( such as salbutamol ). if you do not have a quick - acting inhaler contact your doctor. fluticasone furoate belongs to a group of medicines called corticosteroids, often simply called steroids. corticosteroids reduce inflammation. they reduce the swelling and irritation in the small air passages in the lungs and so gradually ease breathing problems. corticosteroids also help to prevent attacks of asthma and aggravation of copd. vilanterol belongs to a group of medicines called long acting bronchodilators. it relaxes the muscles of the small air passages in the lungs. this helps to open the airways and makes it easier for air to get in and out of the lungs. when it is taken regularly, it helps the small air passages to remain open. when you take these two active substances together regularly, they will help to control your breathing difficulties more than either medicine alone.
