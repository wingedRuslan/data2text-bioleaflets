your doctor has given you nespo ( an anti - anaemic ) to treat your anaemia . anaemia is when your blood does not contain enough red blood cells and the symptoms may be fatigue , weakness and shortness of breath . nespo works in exactly the same way as the natural hormone erythropoietin . erythropoietin is produced in your kidneys and encourages your bone marrow to produce more red blood cells . the active substance of nespo is darbepoetin alfa produced by gene - technology in chinese hamster ovary cells ( cho - k1 ). if you have chronic renal failure nespo is used to treat symptomatic anaemia that is associated with chronic renal failure ( kidney failure ) in adults and children . in kidney failure , the kidney does not produce enough of the natural hormone erythropoietin which can often cause anaemia . because it will take your body some time to make more red blood cells , it will be about four weeks before you notice any effect . your normal dialysis routine will not affect the ability of nespo to treat your anaemia . if you are receiving chemotherapy nespo is used to treat symptomatic anaemia in adult cancer patients with non - bone marrow cancers ( non - myeloid malignancies ) who are receiving chemotherapy . one of the main side effects of chemotherapy is that it stops the bone marrow producing enough blood cells . at first , only white blood cells seem to be affected . this is because the red blood cells have a much longer life span in the circulating blood . towards the end of your chemotherapy course , particularly if you have had a lot of chemotherapy , your red blood cell count may fall making you anaemic .
